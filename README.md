Front-end pour node-pronote / Pronote+

I think that Pronote is slow and hard to use and that Pronote+ v2 is REALLY SLOW and not that easy to use. That's when Pronote+ v3 (project name Papillon) was born.
This is a PWA made for node-pronote and that shows all your Pronote data (except messaging and some specific tabs) on a custom UI made in vanilla JS.

## Installation / Self-hosting
Everything is already there. Just clone the repo to any web server and you can make any changes you want to Papillon, API endpoints and links are already included.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to add new features you want. The code and frameworks were written with collaboration in mind.
